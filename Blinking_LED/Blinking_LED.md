# Blinking LED Task

## Description
This task is a basic embedded systems program that makes two LEDs blink in sync. The built-in LED on the microcontroller and an external red LED will turn on and off at the same time with a fixed delay.

## How It Works
1. The microcontroller's built-in LED and an external red LED are both set as output.
2. In a loop, both LEDs turn on for a short duration.
3. Both LEDs turn off for the same duration.
4. This repeats indefinitely.
